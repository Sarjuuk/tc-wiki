# #Trinity Official IRC Channel
Trinitycore currently has an open IRC channel that can be found at **irc.rizon.net** in the **#Trinity** channel.

You can connect to this using your preferred IRC Client &mdash; [find one here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IRC_clients#General). Alternatively you can use [Rizon Chat](https://rizon.net/chat), an online free-to-use IRC Client.


## Always read the topic

It's the first thing you see when you connect to or join the channel and it is usually at the top of the screen at all times. Read it when you connect, when you join, when you come back from being away. Always.

## We are volunteers!

The people helping out in #Trinity and on www.trinitycore.org or .info are doing so voluntarily and not being compensated in any way. We do not owe you anything, nor are we obligated to respond to you. Please show common courtesy and show your appreciation for everyone giving you their time.

## IRC is not a support channel

Remember, #Trinity is not designed to be a support channel - people just help out when they can. 

There are a number of ways you can get help for the various problems you might encounter. But it's important you:

- Troubleshoot on your own - https://community.trinitycore.org/topic/4046-tired-of-asking-always-the-same-questions/
	- This should include, at a minimum, [searching the forums](https://community.trinitycore.org/search/) for similar problems. TrinityCore has been around for a long time. There's a better than good chance someone else has had your problem and posted asking about it.
- Ask in the right place: [Help forums](https://community.trinitycore.org/forum/5-help-and-support/), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HPP3wNh)

## No excessive profanity

While we have no objection to sharing your opinions and debating a topic - in fact, we encourage it - with other members of this community, we do not tolerate any excessive profanity whatsoever.

A minor or infrequent usage of profanity is permitted. If you are found to be using profanity frequently, your posts will be deemed of a flaming nature and you will be dealt with accordingly.

Since the measure of excessive usage is ultimately decided by channel staff on a case by case basis, you will receive ample warning prior to being banned due to the infringement of this clause.

## No racism, discrimination, threats, harassment or personal attacks of any kind are permitted

This is a friendly community and as such you are expected to be courteous and follow general chatting etiquette. There are times when you may not agree with someone, or you've had a bad day and that's fine, we all have those days. But please, for your own benefit, leave your problems off Trinitycore.org and our of the channel. Doing so will ensure that the TrinityCore Community is a welcoming, friendly one and not machiavelli drunk on any day that ends in the word day.

## No spamming is permitted whatsoever

Spam is posting any content that is not within the topic of discussion, or does not contribute anything to the channel - off topic OR on topic. The definition of spam used by this community is determined by the channel staff and is not open to discussion.

Spam also constitutes, but is not limited to, messages that are formatted incorrectly (has excessive colour, bold etc.) or is in all caps, mixed caps or any other formatting deemed intrusive or annoying by the channel staff.

## No flaming, inciting hatred or instigating flame bait is permitted

This is a friendly community and as such you are expected to be courteous and follow general chatting etiquette.

In general, any parties involved in a flame-fest - whether they be the instigator or the flamer, will be dealt with accordingly. The best way to stay out of trouble, with regards to flame-fests, is to not join in.

## No selling of products or services, unless approved by a member of the channel staff.

Don't do it.

## Don't ask for a position on staff

For those of you interested in being a part of the TrinityCore Community staff, here's some advice: Since launching we've received requests from people to be a part of our staff - be it IRC, wiki, community, etc. but what is important to note is that the vast majority of those requests have been accompanied by a lack of initiative being shown.

Show some initiative and your work will be noticed, along with your attitude and your passion for the community and the chances of us picking you up to help out will be higher. This should really have gone without saying.

If you ask for a position or privileges, you reduce the chances of your getting it. You shouldn't have to ask; you demonstrate that you fit the bill and things should fall into line.

## No advertising
Advertising of any form is completely prohibited unless otherwise stated by channel staff.

## Don't spam massive walls of code
Use one of the following services to share large blocks of code for review or troubleshooting.

- [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com)
- [Pastie](https://pastie.org)
- [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com)

## English only, please

Please try and speak English only in our channel as our staff do not understand any other languages, making it difficult to moderate the channel effectively. Please also refrain from bastardising the English language through the use of "txt speak" as it is very annoying and has no place on IRC.


## Additionally...
- Ignorance isn't a valid defense
- No vulgarity or obscenity
- Disrespect and intolerance towards other people is NOT acceptable
- BE PATIENT and no excessive repeating
