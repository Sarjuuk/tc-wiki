Sadly, there's very little I can do for you until I get all of my supplies.\$b\$bI've now got \$3223w percent of the razorthorn roots I need to get started. Any assistance you provide will be well worth the effort, I assure you. - The alchemy lab is not quite yet ready, \$n. Mar'nah says that she is \$3223w percent done with its assembly, however.\$B\$BIf you would like to help her with that, you will find her inside the inn at the Sun's Reach Harbor. - quest=11522 http://www.wowhead.com/quest=11520/discovering-your-roots |
| 3228 | QUEST_MAKING_READY_TOTAL_GOAL | http://www.wowhead.com/npc=25046/smith-hauthaa // Hello, \$r.\$b\$bLet's get busy! No sense waiting around for supplies that may never arrive.\$b\$bI need my anvil in order to outfit our troops properly. Right now It's \$3228w percent complete.\$b\$bAnd when the anvil is completed, there will be many more powerful items that I will be able to smith for you. - Last I heard from Hauthaa, she indicated that we are \$3228w percent of the way there.\$B\$BI cannot express how vital it is to our efforts that we get them created. Our men and women are going to need better armor and weapons, and the anvil and forge are the key to that.\$B\$BYou will find the smith behind the Sun's Reach Armory, \$n. |
| 3233 | QUEST_UNK_02_TOTAL_GOAL | My orders are to create a distraction at the Dead Scar so our forces can take the Sun's Reach Armory. It might not be as glamorous as killing demons face to face, but if it wins us this battle then I'm all for it.\$B\$BWe are \$3233w percent done with our goal. - Capturing the Sun's Reach Sanctum was the first step in our battle plan. Our orders are to take control of the armory next.\$B\$BWe are \$3233w percent done with our goal. - I am glad that you ask. Our efforts to take the armory are at \$3233w percent of our projections.\$B\$BI know that Battlemage Arynna and Harbinger Inuuro need your help. Seek them inside the Sun's Reach Sanctum on the Isle of Quel'Danas. - http://www.wowhead.com/quest=11539/taking-the-harbor |
| 3238 | QUEST_UNK_03_TOTAL_GOAL | No, unfortunately we have not yet taken the harbor. However, reports indicate that we are \$3238w percent of the way towards doing so.\$B\$B\$n, if you want to help out, look for Magister Ilastar and Vindicator Kaalan at the Sun's Reach Armory on the Isle of Quel'Danas. |
| 3244 | QUEST_FURTHER_CONVERSIONS_TOTAL_GOAL | Have you seen the damaged sentries that wander the island? A few modifications to the crystals that control their behavior will allow us to gain control of them and use them to secure tactical locations.\$B\$BThe Sun's Reach Sanctum will be ours in no time. We are \$3244w percent done with this goal. - Arming the wards at the sanctum will help us secure it faster. We don't want any Wretched getting in our way when we unleash a full scale attack on the Legion and Kael.\$B\$BWe are \$3244w percent done with our goal. - http://www.wowhead.com/quest=11525/further-conversions |
| 3255 | QUEST_UNK_04_GATE_1_TOTAL_GOAL | The first gate, Agamath, has been dismantled! The second gate of Rohendor now blocks our passage.\$B\$BOur mages are \$3255w percent through the defenses of the second gate, Rohendor. |
| 3257 | QUEST_UNK_05_GATE_2_TOTAL_GOAL | Rohendor has been obliterated. Only the gateway, Archonisus, remains.\$B\$BOur mages are \$3257w percent through the defenses of the final gate, Archonisus. |
| 3269 | QUEST_UNK_02_SUNWELL_PORTAL_PERCENT_COMPLETED | If we are to be successful in the creation of a portal to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and the Sunwell which rests upon it, we must acquire an energy source powerful enough to ignite the portal.\$B\$BWe are \$3269w percent completed with our efforts. Will you assist us, \$c? |
| 3275 | QUEST_UNK_06_TOTAL_GOAL | I'm gathering funds to build a monument in honor of those who've died in the war. It is important to not forget the sacrifices we've made to achieve victory.\$B\$BWe are \$3275w percent done with this goal. |
