# Core Installation

> **Note:** 
> Trinitycore is divided into 2 branches. These are **3.3.5** (Wrath of the Lich King) & **Master** (follows the current live version of WoW). 
> 3.3.5 is recommended for everyone. 
> Master has hardly any game content and should therefore not be taken with the intention of having a good gaming experience.
> Within the instructions we will make an explicit distinction between these two branches at some points.
> Read each chapter carefully and follow the steps for your planned game version.
