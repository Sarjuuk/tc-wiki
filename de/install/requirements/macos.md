## Sources
The following dependencies have to be installed from sources for every branch of TrinityCore:

- [Boost 1.69.0](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.69.0/source/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz)
- [CMake 3.14.3](https://cmake.org/files/v3.14/cmake-3.14.3.tar.gz)

Alternatively, if you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can copy-paste the following. A detailed guide can be found here: [[HowTo] Compile TrinityCore on Mac OS X using Homebrew](http://www.trinitycore.org/f/topic/10515-howto-compile-trinitycore-on-mac-os-x-using-homebrew)
