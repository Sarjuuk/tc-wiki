# Description
TrinityCore has not established [a systematic incident priority process](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/Checklist_Incident_Priority) yet. 

Instead, the project has been using a classification system based on customs and traditions. 
At the moment, the following are the classifications that are commonly known, although they have not been defined by the project owners nor by consensus and, as such, should not be considered final:

| Classification | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | constant crashes, data loss |
| High | crashes with easy repo way |
| Low | not working quests, missing creature spawns, ... |
| Cosmetic | missing emotes, paths, ... |
