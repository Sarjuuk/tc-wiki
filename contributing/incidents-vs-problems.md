# Description
At the moment, TrinityCore does not differentiate between [incidents](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/ITIL_Glossary/_ITIL_Terms_I#Incident) and [problems](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/ITIL_Glossary/_ITIL_Terms_P#Problem).

Because of that, most tickets that report incidents tend to be closed in favor of maintaining a single ticket in which its corresponding problem is defined. As such, testers reporting incidents should be aware that their reports might end up being closed.
