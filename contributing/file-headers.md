# Goal
To make things look uniform here's the headers we use for sourcefiles.

It makes it "prettier" as it's applied to any of the sourcefiles (source and headers) , giving us a template licensing-style that we stick to (or at least keeping in the same style licensewise).

The individual information about external developers, which some code originated from, are stored inside the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/blob/master/AUTHORS) file (mentioned in the header).
